clsat - OpenCL SAT solver
-------------------------

clsat is a small, incomplete, stochastic local search, OpenCL-based SAT
solver.

The algorithm is as follows:
 - Iterate over all the clauses in the instance
 - Evaluate each clause under the current valuation
 - If a clause is unsatisfied, flip the current value of one of the
   unsatisfied literals
 - Keep going until all the clauses are satisfied

The implementation is designed to work well on GPUs, e.g. by having all
threads examine the same clause at the same time, utilising local/shared
memory, eliminating branches, etc.


Compiling
---------

You need to have the AMD APP SDK installed to compile and run the program.

    $ g++ -Wall -g -I<path/to/AMD-APP-SDK>/include -L<path/to/AMD-APP-SDK>/lib/<arch> main.cc -lOpenCL


To-do
-----

 - Split clauses of length > 4 into many smaller clauses
 - Support for XOR clauses
 - Use u32 for literals (we are currently limited to 32,767 variables)
 - Optimisations!
    - Different types may be faster
    - Use vector types/operations if/where possible
